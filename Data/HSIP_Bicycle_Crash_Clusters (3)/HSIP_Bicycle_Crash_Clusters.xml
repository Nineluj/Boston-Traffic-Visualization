<abstract>2004-2013 Highway Safety Improvement Program Bicycle Crash Cluster Locations.Â This layer shows the top 5% of bicyclist crash clusters for each Regional Planning Agency between the years of 2004-2013.</abstract>
<purpose>The top locations where reported collisions occurred between bicyclists and motor vehicles have been identified. The crash cluster analysis methodology for the top bicyclist clusters uses a fixed meter search distance of 100 meters (328 ft.) to merge crash clusters together. Located crashes between motor vehicles and bicyclists were identified by using the non-motorist type code within the CDS database (which may yield different results from using most harmful event, first harmful event, or sequence of events data fields). Furthermore, the methodology uses the Equivalent Property Damage Only (EPDO) weighting to rank the clusters. However, because of the relatively small number of reported bicyclist crashes in the crash data file, the clustering analysis used crashes from the ten year period from 2004-2013. Additionally, due to the larger geographic area encompassed by the bicyclist crash clusters, it was difficult to name them so they were left unnamed but can be viewed spatially.</purpose>
